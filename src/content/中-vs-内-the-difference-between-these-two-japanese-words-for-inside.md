If you're reading this, I'm assuming you already know the words 中 (naka) and 内 (uchi). But do you really know them? Most dictionaries list "inside" as the first definition for both 中 and 内. Our kanji learning app WaniKani also teaches the primary meaning of both 中 and 内 as in "inside."

However, despite enormous overlap in their meanings, they are not always interchangeable! For example, to say "inside the box," you'd usually use 中 rather than 内, as in 箱の中.

That's because, while they do both mean "inside," they don’t refer to quite the same "inside." You didn't realize there could be more than one inside? You're not alone! Read on to explore the differences using images, and then see how your new understanding applies to a bunch of different examples.

> Prerequisites: This article assumes you already know hiragana and katakana. If you need to brush up, have a look at our Ultimate Hiragana Guide and Ultimate Katakana Guide. It also assumes you’re already familiar with 中 and 内, and you’re ready to delve into the intricacies of what makes them different.


## CONCEPTS OF 中 AND 内:
<a name='concept'></a>

So what’s the difference between 中 and 内, really? To understand this, please take a look at the two images below.

![dumb things](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/concept-of-naka-and-uchi.jpg)

In the left image, you can see 中 is inside the box, while top and bottom, front and back, and left and right are labeled on each side of the box. This is to show that 中 represents the center or the middle, and it can also mean the entire inside. In short, 中 is simply pointing to the inside position in relation to the other positions.

In the right-hand image above, the inside of the box is pink and everything outside is green. This is because 内 always implies a contrast with 外 (outside). You are highlighting the inside of something as opposed to the outside. So 内 points to the fact that something is "within a surrounding." It does more than just pointing to the central or internal position.

Now let’s check out examples for 中 and 内.

So imagine you received a gift box. You open the lid, and there’s an additional box inside it. You can say, "there’s another box in the 中 of the box."

```
Japanese
箱の中にもう一つ箱があります。

English
There's another box inside the box.
```

In the same vein, 中 can also refer to a middle position, because it’s basically the inside position in relation to the both sides, edges, or ends of something. So your middle finger is called 中指 (middle-finger) because it’s the middle thing of five things.😜 When it comes to size or grade, 中 also stands for something that's in the "middle," relative to other things, as in 大中小 (large-medium-small) or 上中下 (upper-middle-lower), as it points to the medium status in relation to the other sizes or grades. So for example, 中ジョッキ is a medium beer mug, and 中学生 is a middle school student.

For 内, let's go back to the gift box example. You open the lid, and there’s the second box inside. You might refer to the inner box as 内箱うちばこ or 内側うちがわの箱 and to the outer box as 外箱そとばこ or 外側そとがわの箱, because in this case you're treating the two boxes as a pair.

```
Japanese
外箱は青ですが、内箱は茶色です。

English
The outer box is blue, but the inner box is brown.
```

## CHOOSING BETWEEN 中 AND 内
<a name='choosing'></a>
Now that you’ve learned the basic concepts of 中 and 内, let’s apply these concepts to some real world examples. We’ll move through a range of different contexts to help with your understanding of 中 and 内. We’ll first explore how 中 and 内 are used with physical spaces, and then we’ll also talk about how they are used with a time period!

### 中 OR 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES
<a name='or'></a>

#### 中 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES
<a name='naka'></a>

In its most common use, 中 refers to the inside of something. Imagine you receive another box, and open it to find a ukulele. To describe this situation, you can say:

```
Japanese
箱を開けると、中にはウクレレが入っていた。

English
When I opened the box, there was a ukulele inside.
```

Here, 中 is your choice because you are simply talking about where the ukulele is located. There is no contrast with the outside of the box, so you wouldn't use 内.

Let’s take a look at another example. Imagine you are getting ready to go out, and you put your smartphone in your bag. In this case, you'll want to use 中 because you are simply pointing to the location of your smartphone. Again, no inside/outside contrast here, we're indicating the position, pure and simple.

```
Japanese
スマホをかばんの中に入れた。

English
I put the smartphone inside the bag.
```

In the same way, if you are going for a walk and feel a stone in your shoe, you may say:

```
Japanese
くつの中に石が入っちゃった。

English
There's a stone in my shoe.
(Literally: A stone entered inside my shoe.)
```

Again, you're not contrasting the stone inside your shoe with all those stones on the path. You're simply stating the location of the stone, so 中 makes the most sense here too.

So far so good? To consolidate your understanding, let’s examine a couple more examples. Imagine you belong to a basketball club. Usually, your team practices in the school yard, but was raining today, so you played basketball in the gymnasium.

```
Japanese
雨が 降ふっていたので、 体育館たいいくかんの中でバスケをした。

English
It was raining so we played basketball inside the gymnasium.
```

At first glance, this example seems to be making a contrast and 内 may feel more suitable because you chose the inside of the gymnasium for playing basketball as opposed to the outside. If you used 内, however, it would sound like you're highlighting the walls of the gymnasium as a boundary separating the inside from the outside. It puts emphasis on within the boundary (the gymnasium) and it sounds a bit odd with this example, similar to if you said "we played within the gymnasium" in English.

In this sentence, you are still simply pointing to the place where you play basketball. It may be making a contrast to the outdoors in general, but there is no stress on the dividing line. Hence 中 is your choice!

Okay, now the last example for this section. Let’s say people belonging to a dance club didn’t care about the rain and they danced outside. To say "they danced in the rain," in Japanese we consider it as dancing inside the rain, or in the middle of the raindrops. To refer to this, you’d use 中, as in:

```
Japanese
雨の中でダンスをした。

English
They danced in the rain.
```

Yet again, you're describing your location as being in the middle of the rain. There is no implication that there are other places where it's not raining, so this should be 雨の中. There is no comparison between 内 and 外 here!

#### 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES
<a name='uchi'></a>

As you've seen, 中 is used simply to indicate a location. When 内 is chosen, on the other hand, there is a comparison between 内 and 外.

Unlike 中, which can be used as a standalone word in various situations, 内 is more commonly used in jukugo (words that are made up of two or more kanji) when referring to physical spaces. These jukugo words usually come in pairs: one half of the pair is 内 plus another kanji, and the other half is 外 plus that same kanji.

One of the most common of these pairs is 内側うちがわ and 外側そとがわ. The kanji 側がわ means "side" and it makes it clearer that you are referring to either the inside or the outside of something. So if your teacher instructs you to write your name on the inside of your baseball cap, she may say:

```
Japanese
キャップの内側に名前を書いてください。

English
Please write your name inside the baseball cap.
```

We use 内 and not 中 here because you are not talking about the middle of your baseball cap, but rather the inside surface as opposed to the outside surface.

You'll also often hear 内側 in announcements on Japanese train station platforms, as in:

```
Japanese
危険きけんですから、 白線はくせんの内側でお 待まち下さい。

English
For your safety, please wait behind the white line.
(Literally: Because of the danger, please wait inside the white line.)
```

In this case, 内側 refers to the area behind the white line on the platform edge, and there is an implicit contrast with the other side of the white line, which is considered 外側.

Another common pair related to Japanese trains is 内回うちまわり and 外回そとまわり. The word 回まわり means "rotation," and 内回り means "the inside track" as opposed to 外回り, which means "the outside track."

This pair is often used to refer to double railway loop lines, like the famous Tokyo loop line, the Yamanote-sen, and its Osaka counterpart, the Kanjō-sen.

![dumb thing](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/Yamanote-line.jpg)

As well as other kanji, 内 can also be combined with whole words to form jukugo.



For example, if 内 is combined with the word ポケット, as in 内うちポケット, it means an inside pocket. Although an outside pocket can be referred to as 外そとポケット, especially when you are making a comparison, it is more commonly just called ポケット.

This is probably because, just like in English, the word ポケット tends to make us think of a pocket on the outside. If we're talking about an inside pocket, we usually need to specify that, and there's generally an implied contrast with the outside pocket. Maybe you want to specify that you are talking about your hidden, inside pocket that you can hide your secret stuff in.

![dumb thing](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/inner-pocket.jpg)

So to sum it up, when you want to highlight the inside half of a pair, you’d probably go with 内!

#### 中 AND 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES
<a name='and'></a>
I hope you are getting the hang of it. Now let’s look at some examples of where both 中 and 内 are possible. The first example is yet another train-related one. You may hear the following announcement when you are in a Japanese train:

```
Japanese
車内しゃないでの 通話つうわはご 遠慮えんりょください。

English
Please refrain from making phone calls in the train.
```

Here, 車内 refers to the inside of the train, and its opposite is 車外, meaning "outside the train." 1 Unlike the earlier gymnasium example, putting emphasis on the boundary between the inside and outside of the train car makes more sense here. It strengthens the point that you should not make phone calls inside the train, while implying that it’s okay to do so outside the train. This nuance is actually very subtle, and most Japanese speakers probably aren't even aware of it, but the implication is there nonetheless.

You could also use 中, as in 電車の中, and it simply indicates you are neutrally talking about the location in that case. However, train announcements always use 車内. Why? This actually has nothing to do with the nuance distinction between 内 and 中. It is simply a question of register: jukugo words (that's words consisting of two or more kanji) tend to sound more formal, so the use of 車内 rather than 電車の中 makes the announcement sound more official. Hence, the jukugo word 車内 is more suitable for official train announcements, while you can either use 電車の中 or 車内 in daily conversation depending on how casual or formal you want to sound.

Just like Japanese train conductors asking people not to make calls in the train, teachers may tell students not to run inside the school building. In this case, they can use both 中 or 内, as in:

```
Japanese
学校の中で走らない！
校内で走らない！

English
Don’t run inside the school!
```

Again, 中 neutrally indicates the inside of the school, whereas 校内 highlights the boundary between the inside and outside of the school. Like the train announcement example, the differences between them are quite subtle and word choice may depend purely on the level of formality the person wants to convey. For example, teachers may go with 学校の中 for younger students, whereas 校内 may be selected for older students, since teachers tend to use more formal language with older students. There's also a question of understanding here, as younger students may understand 学校の中 more easily than 校内.

Our next example is about a soccer rule:

```
Japanese
ペナルティエリアの中で 反則はんそくをすると、ペナルティキックになる。
ペナルティエリア 内ないで 反則はんそくをすると、ペナルティキックになる。

English
If you commit a foul in the penalty area, there'll be a penalty kick.
```

To refer to the inside of the penalty area, you can use both 中 or 内, but the nuances are slightly different. If you use 中, it simply indicates you are pointing to the inside of the penalty area, and that works just fine. On the other hand, 内 highlights the foul being made within the boundary of the penalty area. So if you’d like to put emphasis on the contrast between the penalty area and non-penalty area, then you might go with 内.

What if you are talking about a bigger area, like a town? So let’s say your brother is the tallest person in the town where you live. When you say "in the town" like this, you’re not making a comparison between people inside and outside of the town. So, out of the two options, 中 is the most likely, though 内 can work too. 2

```
Japanese
兄はこの町の中で一番 背せが高い。
兄はこの町内で一番 背せが高い。

English
My brother is the tallest in this town.
```

The reason 内 also works is because you are technically highlighting the whole area of the town as a range of height comparison. It also inadvertently compares with the outside of the town, implying that he may not be the tallest person in the country, but he is the tallest in town. 3 So again, this comes down to personal choice and the nuance you want to convey.

The next example may be a little more challenging. Imagine you get into a quarrel with a family member. It upsets you, and you run into your room, slam the door, and lock it from the inside. In this case, either 中 or 内 can be used, as in:

```
Japanese
中からカギをかけた。
内からカギをかけた。

English
I locked the door from the inside.
```

When using 中, you are simply indicating the location from which the door was locked. If you use 内, it highlights the door as the boundary between your room and the rest of the house. Choosing 内 could perhaps characterize your perception of the events that just occurred, and your mental and emotional state in response to it, such as feeling defensive towards what is outside of your room.

Note that we used 内 alone in this example. It actually feels a bit archaic to use 内 alone when talking about physical spaces, and it generally establishes a literary or poetic tone. Unless that’s the style you’re aiming for, it’s more common to use the compound word 内側, which we saw earlier also means "inside." So, if your little one locked you out and you are describing the situation objectively to your partner, either 中 or 内側 is probably your choice! If you're writing poetry, or writing in your diary about your emotions and want to add some literary flair, go ahead and use 内 on its own!

It's worth mentioning, though, that there are situations where the concepts suggest that both should be possible, but quirks in the way language develops mean that only one is actually used. For example, if your children are hyper and screaming in the house, you may tell them:

```
Japanese
⭕ 家の中でさけばない！
❌ 家内でさけばない！

English
Don't scream inside the house!
```

In this case, you are telling your child that it’s not okay to be loud inside the house, implying that it may be allowed outside. Even if you want to highlight this contrast, 内 is not an option.

This is because 家内 is already established as a completely different word. It is a slightly old-fashioned way of saying "my wife," so it cannot be used to refer to the inside of the house. Cases like this are the exception rather than the rule, though, and you'll get to know them over time.

### LOTS MORE WORDS IN REAL LIFE!
<a name='more'></a>

We are coming to the end of our exploration of 中 and 内. Hopefully you were able to grasp the basic concepts of these two words, and are now coming away with a better feel for how these two words are used in the real world.

To wrap it up, 中 neutrally refers to the middle, medium, or central position or part, while 内 refers to an inside that is surrounded by an outside, highlighting the boundary between the inside and the outside.

中 and 内 are very common words and we didn’t cover all of their uses in this article, so you’ll still run into new usages in the wild. Before you forget what you learned here, or 忘わすれない内に, please try to remember the 中 and 内 uses you’ve encountered before, and consider why each was chosen. And of course, keep an eye out for these words as you read and listen to Japanese. It will help consolidate your idea of the two words, and you’ll be better equipped for the new uses awaiting you!
