If you're reading this, I'm assuming you already know the words 中 (naka) and 内 (uchi). But do you really know them? Most dictionaries list "inside" as the first definition for both 中 and 内. Our kanji learning app WaniKani also teaches the primary meaning of both 中 and 内 as in "inside."

However, despite enormous overlap in their meanings, they are not always interchangeable! For example, to say "inside the box," you'd usually use 中 rather than 内, as in 箱の中.

That's because, while they do both mean "inside," they don’t refer to quite the same "inside." You didn't realize there could be more than one inside? You're not alone! Read on to explore the differences using images, and then see how your new understanding applies to a bunch of different examples.
