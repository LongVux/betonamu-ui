### THE BASICS
<a name='the-basic'></a>
<text>The particle と wears a lot of hats, but its fundamental meaning is quite simple — to connect two or more things together as companions.</text>

### <faded>と = TOGETHER</faded>
<a name='together'></a>
<text>We like to think of と's fundamental meaning as marking togetherness. Particle と is like a companion marker — when a word is marked by と, we know it's part of a pair or a group, or has some kind of companionship with other words or elements in the sentence.</text></br>
<text>To help drive this point home, let me introduce two penguin companions, ペン太 and ペン子. These penguin pals are always together (or と-gether 😉) because they're great friends:</text><br/>

<br/>
```console
JAPANESE
彼女に電話をした。

ENGLISH
Penta and Penko are friends.
```
<br/>
<text>
In this sentence, と comes between the two penguins, ペン太 and ペン子, just like the word "and." As you read on, you'll see that particle と can pop up in different places, and take slightly different meanings. However, keep in mind the togetherness of our penguin pals, and all the different uses will make sense!

## Uses of と
<a name='uses-of-と'></a>
### <faded>と AS IN "AND"</faded>
<text>Just like you saw before with our penguin friends, particle と can be used to connect two or more nouns in a similar way to "and" in English. This applies to all kinds of nouns, from places you plan to go, to food you want to eat:</text>
<br/>
```console
JAPANESE
トマトとバナナを食べる。

ENGLISH
I'm going to eat tomatoes and bananas.
```
<br/>
<text>In this sentence, と connects トマト and バナナ into a pair. To connect more than two items, you can simply repeat と, like:</text>

```console
JAPANESE
トマトとバナナとケーキとラーメンとすしを食べる。

ENGLISH
I'm going to eat tomatoes, bananas, cake, ramen and sushi.
```
<text>It's simple and easy, but I hope your stomach is okay. 🍅🍌🍰🍜🍣😅</text>

<br/>

### <faded>と AS IN "WITH"</faded>
<text>Particle と can also be used to mean something like "with" in English. In this case, the noun that comes before と indicates who is together with you as you do an activity. So if you ate tomatoes with your little sister, you can say:</text>

```console
JAPANESE
妹とトマトを食べた。

ENGLISH
I ate tomatoes with my little sister.
```
<text>In this example, と marks 妹いもうと (little sister) as the person accompanying you on your tomato eating adventure.

Were there others joining in the feast with you and your 妹? In this case, you can connect them with と, as in "and," like:</text>

```console
JAPANESE
妹と弟とトマトを食べた。

ENGLISH
I ate tomatoes with my little sister and my little brother.
```
<text>In this case, the と between 妹 and 弟おとうと (little brother) works like "and," connecting the two of them together. The と after 弟 works like "with," marking your 妹 and 弟 as the people who ate the tomatoes with you.

What if you ate more foods with more people? Well, you simply connect everyone together using と.</text>
```console
JAPANESE
妹と弟とお父さんとお母さんとトマトとバナナとケーキとラーメンとすしを食べた。

ENGLISH
I ate tomatoes, bananas, cake, ramen, and sushi with my little sister, my little brother, my father, and my mother.
```
<text>Just like the English translation, this is kind of an unpleasant sentence in Japanese. Seriously, that's too (と) much と for me!</text>

### <faded>と FOR LISTING OPTIONS</faded>
<text>The particle と can also be used to list options, in which case it will be accompanied by a "which one?" question.
<br/>For example, to list beverage options and ask "which one would you like?" you can connect the options with と and ask:</text>
```console
JAPANESE
牛乳とジュースと紅茶とコーヒー(と)、どれがいいですか？

ENGLISH
Which would you like: milk, juice, tea, or coffee?
```
<text>
In this case, と ends up meaning something more like "or," but these beverages are all still together in the same group — available drink options.<br/>Notice that the final と, which comes after コーヒー, is in parentheses. While it can be included, the と that comes after the last noun tends to be omitted.</text>


## BEYOND THE BASICS
<a name='beyond-the-basic'></a>
<text>In this section, we'll explore some advanced uses of と, while comparing them with the basic concept of と (togetherness).</text>
### <faded>と FOR INTERACTIVE ACTIONS</faded>
<p>You've learned that と can be used like "with" in English, and it marks someone who is engaged in the same activity as the subject. Sometimes, however, the Japanese idea of "with" is quite different from the English one. For example, to say you kissed your girlfriend, you can use と and say:</p>

```console
JAPANESE
彼女とキスをした。

ENGLISH
I kissed my girlfriend.
(Literally: I kissed with my girlfriend.)
```

<p>In this example, と marks 彼女 (your girlfriend) as the person with whom the action was done . The nuance here is that both "you" and "your girlfriend" were engaged in the kissing together. This highlights that it was interactive and both parties were mutually involved.

However, there are times when you want to show some directionality: who kissed whom? To do this, you would use <span style="color:red">particle に</span>:<p/>

```console
JAPANESE
彼女にキスをした。

ENGLISH
I kissed my girlfriend.
(Literally: I kissed to my girlfriend.)
```

<p>Here, に marks 彼女 (your girlfriend) as the destination for your kiss, which implies that you initiated the action.<br/>The same concept applies to other verbs that can be both be mutual and unidirectional. For example, if you are having an interactive phone call, you use と to say:</p>

```console
JAPANESE
彼女と電話をした。

ENGLISH
I called my girlfriend.
(Literally: I called with my girlfriend.)
```
