### THE BASICS
<a name='the-basic'></a>
<text>The particle „Å® wears a lot of hats, but its fundamental meaning is quite simple ‚Äî to connect two or more things together as companions.</text>

### <faded>„Å® = TOGETHER</faded>
<a name='together'></a>
<text>We like to think of „Å®'s fundamental meaning as marking togetherness. Particle „Å® is like a companion marker ‚Äî when a word is marked by „Å®, we know it's part of a pair or a group, or has some kind of companionship with other words or elements in the sentence.</text></br>
<text>To help drive this point home, let me introduce two penguin companions, „Éö„É≥Â§™ and „Éö„É≥Â≠ê. These penguin pals are always together (or „Å®-gether üòâ) because they're great friends:</text><br/>

In this sentence, „Å® comes between the two penguins, „Éö„É≥Â§™ and „Éö„É≥Â≠ê, just like the word "and." As you read on, you'll see that particle „Å® can pop up in different places, and take slightly different meanings. However, keep in mind the togetherness of our penguin pals, and all the different uses will make sense!
