Fundamental ingredients in Japanese sentences, we learn them early in our studies, yet they are so difficult to pin down that they tend to come back to haunt us over and over.\r\n\r\nAn indication of the complexity of は and が is the sheer volume of academic writing dedicated to it. It still incites lively debate among linguists, even after over fifty years of research. It also confounds native and non-native speakers of Japanese alike. If you want to test this out, go ahead and ask any native speaker of Japanese (without Japanese teaching experience) to explain their choice of は or が in even the simplest of sentences, and watch the confusion and soul-searching that ensues.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the use of は and が often boils down to native-speaker intuition. And like all good native-speaker intuition, it's as hard to put into words for native speakers as it is for the rest of us. Underpinning that intuition, though, is a bunch of principles, built up in every native speaker's subconscious throughout childhood, and honed over years of exposure to all sorts of real-life uses. The goal of this article, then, is to unpick these elusive principles and bottle up a good dose of that precious native-speaker intuition to hand it over to you. By setting out the underlying principles in the simplest possible terms, and examining them in all kinds of different situations, we hope to clear up some of the fog that lingers around は and が.\r\n\r\n- What is the difference between は and が?\r\n- The Pieces in the は and が Puzzle\r\n  - Puzzle Piece Number One: が Points Out the Subject\r\n  - Puzzle Piece Number Two: は Shines a Spotlight on the Topic\r\n  - Puzzle Piece Number Three: Disappearing Acts\r\n  - Puzzle Piece Number Four: It's All About the Emphasis\r\n- は and が in the Wild\r\n  - は and が in Casual Conversation\r\n  - は and が in Storytelling\r\n- The Final Curtain\r\n\r\n> Prerequisites: This article assumes you already know hiragana and katakana. If you need to brush up, have a look at our Ultimate Hiragana Guide and Ultimate Katakana Guide. You may also want to check out our grammar pages on は and が to give you more background on each particle individually, before diving into the differences between the two. This articles starts with the basic principles, and progresses through increasingly nuanced and obscure applications of these principles. Beginners might want to skim the later sections, and return to them whenever you feel like the は/が fog is thickening around you!\r\n\r\n## WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN は AND が?\r\nThe question \"What's the difference between は and が?\" is a little problematic in itself. It implies that は and が are part of a two-piece set, and that's not actually the case. They do, however, both belong to a much larger set of \"particles,\" also known as \"postpositions.\" For beginners out there, particles are somewhat similar to prepositions — like \"in,\" \"to,\" or \"for\" in English — and play important roles in Japanese sentences.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between particles and prepositions is that particles go after the word they're giving clues about — hence their other name \"postpositions.\" For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n日本にほんへ\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nto Japan\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, へ goes after 日本, whereas \"to\" comes before \"Japan.\" So far so good, right?\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few particles in Japanese that don't have equivalent prepositions in English. Can you guess what two of those particles might be? That's right: は and が. Nevertheless, they both behave in the same way as all other particles: they go after a word to give you grammatical information about that word. Very handy!\r\n\r\nThe roles of は and が within that wider particle set are very different, though, and conflating the two can make them seem even more confusing than they actually are. We'll start by taking a look at the fundamental \"meanings\" of these two ubiquitous particles, so that you can apply these concepts whenever は and が crop up, and gradually get better and better acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n## THE PIECES IN THE は AND が PUZZLE\r\n\r\nThere are a few pieces to this puzzle, so let's start by looking at each puzzle piece one by one, before moving on to see how the pieces fit together.\r\n\r\n### PUZZLE PIECE NUMBER ONE: が POINTS OUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nWe're going to kick off our magical mystery tour with が, because this particle has the more clear-cut part to play in a Japanese sentence.\r\n\r\nFrom a grammatical point of view, が goes after a word or phrase to pick it out as the subject of a sentence, or part of a sentence (a \"clause\"). That is, the person or thing before が is doing or being something. It's the protagonist. Grammatically, it's a relatively defined and straightforward role.\r\n\r\n![dumb thing](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-07-07-wa-and-ga/Ga-Points-Out-The-Perpetrator-Or-Subject.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf we turn this concept into an image, が is the witness to an incident, picking out the perpetrator from a lineup. が is telling us, \"they did it!\" or maybe, \"they're going to do it,\" depending on the sentence. So we're stretching our lineup analogy a little bit here. Bear with us while we stretch it a little further, because the perpetrator can in fact be anything: a masked man, twenty dogs, or a teapot. Anything at all. And the \"crime\" can be a verb, like \"murder,\" but it can also be a noun, like \"winner,\" or an adjective, like \"delicious.\"\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a couple of examples to see what we mean.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n子供こどもが 遊あそんでいる。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nA child is playing.\r\n```\r\n\r\n子供 (child) comes before が here, showing us that 子供 is the subject. In other words, 子供 is the person doing the action of \"playing.\" 子供 is the \"perpetrator,\" and we know this because が is helpfully making this clear, by sitting politely right after it and pointing a finger in its direction.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n問題もんだいがある。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThere's a problem.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, look at what comes before が to find the subject of the sentence. In this case it's 問題 (problem). So \"problem\" is the thing that ある (exists). Using our lineup analogy again, が is the witness as always, pointing the finger at 問題. 問題 is the \"perpetrator,\" the protagonist who is doing the verb, in this case \"existing.\"\r\n\r\nこれが 中村先生なかむらせんせいの 家いえだ。\r\nThis is Nakamura-sensei's house.\r\nAs you can see, が is pointing its finger at これ (this). So \"this\" is the perpetrator. In this case the \"crime\" is being Nakamura-sensei's house. これ is the grammatical subject, and the rest of the sentence is the information about that subject.\r\n\r\nその 情報じょうほうが 必要ひつようです。\r\nThat information is necessary.\r\nThis time, が is showing us that その情報 (that information) is the perpetrator, or subject, here. It's その情報 that is being the adjective, so in this case it's being \"necessary.\"\r\n\r\nOkay, one last sentence. Can you tell who is the \"perpetrator\" here?\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nこのチョコが 美味おいしい！\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThis chocolate is delicious!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think you've got the hang of things now! That's right, このチョコ is the subject!\r\n\r\nAn added effect of this lineup feature is that が also excludes all other potential subjects. If you're saying \"this teapot committed the crime,\" you're also absolving all the other teapots in the lineup. So が is telling us the subject of the verb, noun or adjective, and at the same time excluding all other subjects. In other words, depending on the context, a more literal translation of the last sentence might be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nこのチョコが美味しい！\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThis is the chocolate that's delicious!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ability of が to exclude everyone else in the lineup is an important factor in the nuances it can create.\r\n\r\n### PUZZLE PIECE NUMBER TWO: は SHINES A SPOTLIGHT ON THE TOPIC\r\n\r\nは, on the other hand, isn't picking out a specific part of a sentence and telling us its exact grammatical role within that sentence. Rather than showing us our subject, or object, or some other grammatical building block, は is doing something quite magical that most languages can't do explicitly in this way: it's telling us the topic of our sentence, or part of a sentence, or maybe a whole paragraph or more.\r\n\r\n![dumb pic](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-07-07-wa-and-ga/Wa-Shines-A-Spotlight-On-Dino-Topic.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf we imagine for a moment that our conversation or piece of writing is a play, then は is the spotlight, shining on the thing that we want our audience to focus on at that moment. The focus might be the main character in that part of the story, it might be a stage prop, or it might be an important section of the background scenery. But whatever our magical spotlight は is shining on, it sets the tone for that part of the play.\r\n\r\nJust like anything a spotlight might shine on in a play, there are no exact rules as to how far a topic can stretch. は tells our audience: this is the thing we are going to talk about now. This is what we feel is central to our story, or at least this part of our story. We might talk about it for the next few words, or we might talk about it for the rest of the conversation, or the rest of the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe closest equivalent to は in English is probably \"as for,\" and this is how it is often rendered into English in more literal translations. It sometimes works in more natural translations too, but that's the exception rather than the rule. Since \"as for\" is an expression, it's not something that we want to throw into every other sentence, because we'd end up sounding horribly repetitive. は on the other hand, as the equivalent of a preposition, can sit very happily and unobtrusively in as many sentences as we deem it useful, without sounding like we're saying \"as for\" continuously.\r\n\r\nは also goes well beyond the way we use \"as for\" in English, and has all kinds of subtle effects on nuance. These effects are all linked to the fact that は is highlighting our topic, though.\r\n\r\nLet's look at some examples of all the different types of things that could take on topic status in Japanese:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n東京とうきょうは 賑にぎやかな 所ところです。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nTokyo's a lively place.\r\n(Literally: As for Tokyo, it's a lively place.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere our spotlight is shining on Tokyo, so for starters we're saying that Tokyo's lively, and there's every chance that the discussion will continue with Tokyo as our theme. That's certainly the impression that は gives.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nお 水みずは 飲のみました。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nI drank the water.\r\n(Literally: As for the water, I drank it.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe focus of this sentence is the water (お水). By shining our spotlight on お水, we're picking it out as our theme, our topic. In English, we'd consider water to be the object, but in this Japanese sentence, it's the topic, drawing extra attention to the water and very likely adding extra weight to it in terms of nuance, depending on the rest of the conversation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n三月さんがつはチョコを 食たべません。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nI don't eat chocolate in March.\r\n(Literally: As for March, I don't eat chocolate.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example the time period 三月 (March) is having the spotlight shined on it. It is neither the subject nor the object of our sentence, but it is nevertheless the topic that we consider most important at this moment in time.\r\n\r\nBecause は has this spotlight effect, rather than excluding other potential elements in our play, it simply leaves them in the shadows. Rather than saying \"this person, and only this person, is the perpetrator,\" we're simply emphasizing our theme, and leaving other possible themes in the dark. We know they're there, but we don't usually know much else about them. Consequently, the notion of a topic also always carries with it a certain degree of implied contrast with the other potential topics that are lurking in the shadows.\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at another example to see what we mean by this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nこのチョコは 大好だいすき。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nI love this chocolate.\r\n(Literally: As for this chocolate, I love it.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than このチョコ (this chocolate) being our protagonist here, it is our topic. This means that we're focusing on このチョコ, and at the same time leaving other types of chocolate in the shadows. So you're saying you love this chocolate, and also probably implying that there are other types of chocolate that you don't like as much.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which this is important will vary according to the type of sentence, the wider context, and (when speaking) which word you choose to put the stress on. For now it's enough to bear in mind that は can have all kinds of implications about the unmentioned other potential topics.\r\n\r\nThe final characteristic of a topic that we should mention is that it's something identifiable — something we already have in our consciousness. So by telling us that something is the topic, は is introducing something we are already aware of. This has important implications for emphasis, which we'll come back to shortly, as emphasis is our fourth and final puzzle piece.\r\n\r\n### PUZZLE PIECE NUMBER THREE: DISAPPEARING ACTS\r\n\r\nThe next important piece in this puzzle is the fact that so many parts of a sentence can seemingly disappear in Japanese, as long as they are clear from the context.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all languages leave out information that is felt to be obvious. Otherwise we'd constantly be repeating ourselves, and we'd never get anywhere. An example of this habit in most European languages is pronouns, which allow us to refer to something without repeating it again and again:\r\n\r\nI saw Mami the other day. She seems to be doing well.\r\n\r\nIn this sentence, we know intuitively that the pronoun \"she\" refers to Mami. There's no need to repeat her name and indeed doing so would feel a bit weird. It's exactly the same in Japanese, except Japanese goes one step further and doesn't bother with pronouns at all — or at least not pronouns that we can see or hear! So in Japanese, this sentence would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nこの 間あいだマミさんに 会あった。 元気げんきにしてるみたいだよ。\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe know beyond any doubt that the second sentence in the example above is talking about Mami, even though she seems to have done a disappearing act. In fact, she's still there. You don't believe me? We know she's still there because of the previous sentence. She's just invisible. This is a concept that linguists often call \"zero pronouns.\"\r\n\r\n![dumb_img](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-07-07-wa-and-ga/Disappearing-Acts-Or-Zero-Pronouns.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt's really not all that different from English, it just takes things one step further. Whereas we would add \"she\" to the second sentence in English, because we feel that repeating Mami is unnecessary thanks to context, Japanese speakers simply omit Mami altogether. Or rather, they paint her in invisible paint. But in Japanese, the subject of the sentence is no less clear than it would be in English. So in that sense, she's still there. To cut a long story short, we leave out unnecessary information in all languages, but Japanese is more efficient at this disappearing act than most.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid explicitly mentioning pretty much anything in Japanese, as long as our audience can guess that it's there. That could be the topic, the subject, an object, a particle, or even a verb, but for the purposes of this article we're more worried about the subject, topic, and particles, for obvious reasons. Let's stick with subjects and topics for now.\r\n\r\nIn our earlier example 三月はチョコを食べません, we have a topic and an object. There is also a subject, in this case an invisible one. If so, what is it? That will all depend on the context. The subject will have been established at some point earlier in the conversation. If it hasn't been explicitly stated earlier, it will almost always be the person who's speaking. So, without context we would assume that the translation is \"I don't eat chocolate in March,\" but depending on the context, it could easily be \"he,\" \"she,\" or \"they\" who don't eat chocolate in March.\r\n\r\nThe point is that Japanese sentences have both a subject and a theme — they're just very often invisible! Whether or not they're invisible depends on whether we think that our audience can figure them out from context or not. So there are times when neither can be left out, and there are times where one or both can be left out. There are also times when they can be left out, but we choose to leave them in for any number or reasons ranging from clarity, to emphasis, buying thinking time, or even sometimes pure personal preference.\r\n\r\n### PUZZLE PIECE NUMBER FOUR: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EMPHASIS\r\n\r\nWe've seen that all languages leave out information that is deemed superfluous. Another thing that all languages do is emphasize information that we consider to be new, or not easily identifiable or prominent in the consciousness of our audience. In other words, emphasis tells us what information is already out there and what information we want our listener (or reader) to sit up and take notice of.\r\n\r\nThis is the final fundamental puzzle piece in the use of は and が. They can both show us where emphasis lies, and in doing so they make a distinction between information that is already in our consciousness and information that the speaker or writer wants to introduce — or re-introduce — into our consciousness. Information can be considered to be in our consciousness if it's already been mentioned in conversation; if it's predictable because of what has already been said; or if it's common knowledge shared by the people involved.\r\n\r\nHow do は and が fit into this? Let's start with が! You remember how が identifies the \"perpetrator\" (the grammatical subject) and rules out all other possible perpetrators? Because it's introducing the perpetrator, or protagonist, this means that we use it to introduce information that isn't considered to be part of our consciousness yet. In other words, we use が to point out new information, or for information that we feel can't be inferred from context or shared knowledge. And since \"new\" information is always emphasized, が always adds emphasis to whatever comes before it. が points its finger at the perpetrator, and lets us know that this is the focus of what we are saying.\r\n\r\nAs for は (see what we did there?) the added effect of the spotlight is that it actually focuses on the action of whatever it's shining on. The topic is something we already know about, or can guess. It's the \"old news,\" or the news that we believe to be identifiable to our audience. So the focus is on the action surrounding our theme. We're saying \"you remember such-and-such?\" or \"speaking of you-know-what,\" here's the interesting thing about them!\r\n\r\nThis distinction doesn't sound very concrete does it? Let's look at an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n月つきはきれいだ。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe moon's beautiful.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can assume that everyone knows what the moon is. It's therefore ripe to be a possible topic, while leaving other topics in the dark. Once we've introduced the moon as the topic, we can assume that it's also our subject, so it's the moon that's beautiful. This would be a general statement about the moon. It's always beautiful, and everyone agrees.\r\n\r\nBut what about if we left out the topic, and instead included the moon as our subject?\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n月がきれいだ。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe moon's beautiful.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we're picking out the moon as our protagonist and drawing attention to it. We might say this if we just noticed that the moon is particularly beautiful tonight, and we're taken aback by it.\r\n\r\nThis phrase would be very much at home in a longer sentence that also mentions the topic, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n今夜こんやは月がきれいだ。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe moon's beautiful tonight.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this sentence, 今夜 (tonight) is the topic, and the moon remains our subject as before. By shining our spotlight on tonight, we're adding the nuance that other nights may not be blessed with such a beautiful moon!\r\n\r\nAll of these sentences are perfectly fine. The choice is down to the speaker — do we want the moon to be our topic or our subject, or both? What exact nuance do we want to create? Obviously, most speakers don't analyze this when they speak — it just comes naturally.\r\n\r\nIn reality, 月がきれいだ is probably the more common of these two sentences because you might be more likely to point out a particularly beautiful moon than wax lyrical about the beauty of the moon in general. Obviously, though, this depends on the kind of person you are and the kinds of conversations you have!\r\n\r\nIf we were to replace きれい with 丸い (round) on the other hand, which particle do you think would be the more common choice? In this case, we really are talking about an intrinsic characteristic of the moon, one that everyone can agree on, so the more likely choice would be は.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n月は 丸まるい。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe moon's round.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe you're explaining to a young child what the moon looks like! Again, the moon can technically be your visible subject here too, in which case it's the same as for 月がきれいだ. It means you've looked up at the sky to see a full moon and just then it hit you just how round the moon is!\r\n\r\nOf course, how often these exact sentences come up depends on the kinds of situations you find yourself in, but hopefully they give you an idea of the difference between how は and が make a sentence feel.\r\n\r\nThis brings us on to the next step in understanding は and が: how they interact with each other and the nuance they create in real-life speaking and writing.\r\n\r\n## は AND が IN THE WILD\r\nNow that we've looked at how all these elements piece together, let's move onto some examples of how these concepts are applied in real-life situations.\r\n\r\n### は AND が IN CASUAL CONVERSATION\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, the impressive flexibility of Japanese when it comes to leaving out pretty much anything also extends to particles. In casual conversation, は and が are very often omitted, even when the corresponding subjects and topics are kept in.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they can be so easily left out means that they tend to have a greater impact when they are, in fact, left in. This applies to other particles besides は and が, but we'll focus on は and が here.\r\n\r\nCan you see which particles have been left out in the first part of the dialogue? Let's have a look at a few examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n夕飯ゆうはんどうしようか。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nWhat shall we do about dinner?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe overall theme is dinner, which is providing the context for the whole conversation. So 夕飯 is our topic, and would normally have the particle は after it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n夕飯はどうしようか。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nWhat shall we do about dinner?\r\n(Literally: As for dinner, what shall we do?)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to use は here, it would add a little extra emphasis, as if we wanted to make it clear that we're shifting from some other topic to 夕飯.\r\n\r\nIn the next sentence, Sota shifts the focus onto lunch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n昼食ひるくった？\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nDid you have lunch?\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the spotlight is now shining on lunch, the most likely particle here would again be は:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n昼は食った？\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nDid you have lunch?\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can't leave the topic out altogether, because we couldn't possibly know that the focus had shifted to lunch unless it's explicitly stated. However, we can leave out the particle, because our audience knows instinctively that it's our topic.\r\n\r\nLet's look at one more example from this section of the dialogue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n作つくれる 二人ふたりいないっすね。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe two people who can cook aren't around, huh?\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the 作れる二人 could in fact be either the topic or the subject, with very little difference in the meaning. So the missing particle could be は, and the emphasis would be on the fact that they're not around, and it could equally be が, shifting the emphasis onto the two people themselves.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n作れる二人はいないっすね。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe two people who can cook aren't around, huh?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shift in nuance is almost impossible to translate into English, and is something that we'd probably mostly get across using intonation.\r\n\r\nOkay, let's continue with the dialogue. Until now there's been a lot of particle dropping. But when the conversation stops being about only the two involved, and moves to a third housemate, 利沙ちゃん, the が is kept in there to show that 利沙ちゃん is the subject and emphasize the fact that their sick housemate wants udon, so maybe they should make it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n絶対ぜったいダメダメ。でも 利沙りさちゃんが、うどん 食たべたいって言ってたから…\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nIt's definitely a no go. But Risa-chan did say she wanted to eat udon, so…\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen udon becomes the topic, and this time the は is left on, highlighting that if it's something as simple as udon, they can manage. The implication is that any other kind of food might be a challenge but, as for udon, that's doable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nうどんはいけるでしょう。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nIf it's udon it'll surely be okay.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nうどんはできる。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nIf it's udon we can manage.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, they've gone back to being the subjects in their own conversation, so no need to mention them, but we know they're there!\r\n\r\n### は AND が IN STORYTELLING\r\n\r\nAs we saw in the previous section, new characters introduced into the conversation are usually introduced as the subject, and then once they're established in the audience's consciousness, they can take on topic status. Once this happens, they can either be followed by は or, more frequently, they'll become invisible. We all know they're there though, thanks to the context.\r\n\r\n![dummy_img](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-07-07-wa-and-ga/Wa-And-Ga-In-Changing-Scenes.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe've also seen that if we do mention the topic or the subject, this tends to be to create a certain effect. In the following example, the speaker is describing what Kanae did yesterday:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n昨日きのうはカナエちゃんが 梅干うめぼしおにぎりを 作つくった。そして、それを 弁当べんとうにして、カナエちゃんはキャメのアパートに 出でかけていった。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nYesterday, Kanae made pickled plum onigiri. Then she put them into a bento box and she headed out to Cameron's apartment.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first mention of Kanae is followed by が, because she's being introduced into the dialogue for the first time. Then an invisible Kanae packs her lunch box, before reappearing when she goes to see Cameron. The は here is highlighting the transition from bento-making to heading out. It would be perfectly natural not to mention the topic here at all, so the fact that Kanae is explicitly mentioned again creates this feeling that we are changing scenes in the story.\r\n\r\nThis change of scene effect can be found in both speaking and writing. By repeating the topic when it's already obvious to the audience, the speaker shines the spotlight back onto that topic and shows that for some reason there is a break in the storyline or a shift in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nは and が can also be manipulated to create a sense of familiarity or unfamiliarity with the characters. Children's stories are a great example of this. Let's take a look at the opening sentence from the children's book どうぞのいす:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nうさぎさんが　ちいさな　いすを　つくりました。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nA rabbit made a small chair.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the first time we meet the rabbit in the story, so the narrator uses the particle が to introduce this new information. In English, we use \"a\" in this kind of scenario, as you can see in the translation.\r\n\r\nA couple of pages later, once うさぎさん is already in our consciousness and can be the topic, the narrator uses は:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nうさぎさんは　たてふだを　ひとつ　つくりました。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe rabbit made a signboard.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, in English we switch to \"the\" to create the same effect.\r\n\r\nHowever, lots of stories, including the majority of modern novels, start by introducing their characters as the topic, and so follow them by は. There are plenty of examples of this, even in children's books. Let's have a look at the first time we meet the eponymous hero in another picture book, ネズミのゆうびんやさん:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nねずみの　ゆうびんやさんは　かばんに　てがみを　つめこむと、はりきって　そとに　とびだしました。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nPostman Mouse stuffs the letters into his bag as he rushes eagerly outside.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though this is the first time the main character is introduced, the narrator uses は from the very beginning to give us the impression that we're already familiar with this character.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens in most modern novels. We're thrown right into the universe of the novel, creating the impression that the characters already existed before we got there, and were already part of our consciousness.\r\n\r\nLook at the first line of Murakami's short story トニー滝谷:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nトニー 滝谷たきたにの 本当ほんとうの 名前なまえは、 本当ほんとうにトニー 滝谷たきたにだった。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nTony Takitani's real name really was Tony Takitani.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs first-time readers, we couldn't possibly know who Tony Takitani is, yet this opening line creates the impression that we do know him, and that we are in on the story from the start. Making Tony Takitani the topic subtly transmits the feeling that we are already aware of his existence, even though we're not.\r\n\r\nBesides being a nifty tool for changing scenes and designating characters as familiar or unfamiliar, は is a useful device for showing readers the narrator's perspective. は and が are used frequently in creative writing to highlight the point of view of the narrator, point out unusual details, and hint at other subtle points that are often difficult to render adequately into English.\r\n\r\n## THE FINAL CURTAIN\r\n\r\nGetting to grips with は and が will take time and experience, but hopefully you now have a clearer idea of the roles they play, and the different shades of meaning they can bring, and you can look out for them with a trained eye 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️\r\n\r\nGiven that they show up all the time in Japanese, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to apply these concepts and scratch your head over the exact color of each instance. Every time you come across は and が, your understanding of these two vital particles will deepen, and eventually you'll be able to put them in just the right places to create the exact nuance you're going for. これが 美うつくしい 友情ゆうじょうの 始はじまりだ — this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!\r\n"},{"id":2,"title":"中 VS 内 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO JAPANESE WORDS for ''INSIDE''\r","description":"COME INSIDE AND LEARN WHEN 中 AND 内 ARE THE SAME AND WHEN THEY'RE DIFFERENT\r","author":"MAMI SUZUKI\r","date":"2021-12-26T09:01:20.911Z\r","tag":["grammar"," preposition\r"],"level":"N4\r","content":"<style>\r\norange { color: #cb4b16 }\r\nfaded { color: #818a91 }\r\nbold { font-family: bold }\r\ntext { font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.75 }\r\nbox {\r\n  margin: 2rem 0;\r\n  padding: 1rem;\r\n  background-color: pastel\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, I'm assuming you already know the words 中 (naka) and 内 (uchi). But do you really know them? Most dictionaries list \"inside\" as the first definition for both 中 and 内. Our kanji learning app WaniKani also teaches the primary meaning of both 中 and 内 as in \"inside.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, despite enormous overlap in their meanings, they are not always interchangeable! For example, to say \"inside the box,\" you'd usually use 中 rather than 内, as in 箱の中.\r\n\r\nThat's because, while they do both mean \"inside,\" they don’t refer to quite the same \"inside.\" You didn't realize there could be more than one inside? You're not alone! Read on to explore the differences using images, and then see how your new understanding applies to a bunch of different examples.\r\n\r\n## TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n- [Concepts of 中 and 内](#concept)\r\n- [Choosing Between 中 and 内](#choosing)\r\n  - [中 or 内 with Physical Spaces](#or)\r\n     - [中 with Physical Spaces](#naka)\r\n     - [内 with Physical Spaces](#uchi)\r\n     - [中 and 内 with Physical Spaces](#and)\r\n- [Lots More Words In Real Life!](#more)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Prerequisites: This article assumes you already know hiragana and katakana. If you need to brush up, have a look at our Ultimate Hiragana Guide and Ultimate Katakana Guide. It also assumes you’re already familiar with 中 and 内, and you’re ready to delve into the intricacies of what makes them different.\r\n\r\n\r\n## CONCEPTS OF 中 AND 内:\r\n<a name='concept'></a>\r\n\r\nSo what’s the difference between 中 and 内, really? To understand this, please take a look at the two images below.\r\n\r\n![dumb things](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/concept-of-naka-and-uchi.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the left image, you can see 中 is inside the box, while top and bottom, front and back, and left and right are labeled on each side of the box. This is to show that 中 represents the center or the middle, and it can also mean the entire inside. In short, 中 is simply pointing to the inside position in relation to the other positions.\r\n\r\nIn the right-hand image above, the inside of the box is pink and everything outside is green. This is because 内 always implies a contrast with 外 (outside). You are highlighting the inside of something as opposed to the outside. So 内 points to the fact that something is \"within a surrounding.\" It does more than just pointing to the central or internal position.\r\n\r\nNow let’s check out examples for 中 and 内.\r\n\r\nSo imagine you received a gift box. You open the lid, and there’s an additional box inside it. You can say, \"there’s another box in the 中 of the box.\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n箱の中にもう一つ箱があります。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThere's another box inside the box.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, 中 can also refer to a middle position, because it’s basically the inside position in relation to the both sides, edges, or ends of something. So your middle finger is called 中指 (middle-finger) because it’s the middle thing of five things.😜 When it comes to size or grade, 中 also stands for something that's in the \"middle,\" relative to other things, as in 大中小 (large-medium-small) or 上中下 (upper-middle-lower), as it points to the medium status in relation to the other sizes or grades. So for example, 中ジョッキ is a medium beer mug, and 中学生 is a middle school student.\r\n\r\nFor 内, let's go back to the gift box example. You open the lid, and there’s the second box inside. You might refer to the inner box as 内箱うちばこ or 内側うちがわの箱 and to the outer box as 外箱そとばこ or 外側そとがわの箱, because in this case you're treating the two boxes as a pair.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n外箱は青ですが、内箱は茶色です。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThe outer box is blue, but the inner box is brown.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CHOOSING BETWEEN 中 AND 内\r\n<a name='choosing'></a>\r\nNow that you’ve learned the basic concepts of 中 and 内, let’s apply these concepts to some real world examples. We’ll move through a range of different contexts to help with your understanding of 中 and 内. We’ll first explore how 中 and 内 are used with physical spaces, and then we’ll also talk about how they are used with a time period!\r\n\r\n### 中 OR 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES\r\n<a name='or'></a>\r\n\r\n#### 中 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES\r\n<a name='naka'></a>\r\n\r\nIn its most common use, 中 refers to the inside of something. Imagine you receive another box, and open it to find a ukulele. To describe this situation, you can say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n箱を開けると、中にはウクレレが入っていた。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nWhen I opened the box, there was a ukulele inside.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, 中 is your choice because you are simply talking about where the ukulele is located. There is no contrast with the outside of the box, so you wouldn't use 内.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at another example. Imagine you are getting ready to go out, and you put your smartphone in your bag. In this case, you'll want to use 中 because you are simply pointing to the location of your smartphone. Again, no inside/outside contrast here, we're indicating the position, pure and simple.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nスマホをかばんの中に入れた。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nI put the smartphone inside the bag.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if you are going for a walk and feel a stone in your shoe, you may say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nくつの中に石が入っちゃった。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThere's a stone in my shoe.\r\n(Literally: A stone entered inside my shoe.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, you're not contrasting the stone inside your shoe with all those stones on the path. You're simply stating the location of the stone, so 中 makes the most sense here too.\r\n\r\nSo far so good? To consolidate your understanding, let’s examine a couple more examples. Imagine you belong to a basketball club. Usually, your team practices in the school yard, but was raining today, so you played basketball in the gymnasium.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n雨が 降ふっていたので、 体育館たいいくかんの中でバスケをした。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nIt was raining so we played basketball inside the gymnasium.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first glance, this example seems to be making a contrast and 内 may feel more suitable because you chose the inside of the gymnasium for playing basketball as opposed to the outside. If you used 内, however, it would sound like you're highlighting the walls of the gymnasium as a boundary separating the inside from the outside. It puts emphasis on within the boundary (the gymnasium) and it sounds a bit odd with this example, similar to if you said \"we played within the gymnasium\" in English.\r\n\r\nIn this sentence, you are still simply pointing to the place where you play basketball. It may be making a contrast to the outdoors in general, but there is no stress on the dividing line. Hence 中 is your choice!\r\n\r\nOkay, now the last example for this section. Let’s say people belonging to a dance club didn’t care about the rain and they danced outside. To say \"they danced in the rain,\" in Japanese we consider it as dancing inside the rain, or in the middle of the raindrops. To refer to this, you’d use 中, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n雨の中でダンスをした。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nThey danced in the rain.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet again, you're describing your location as being in the middle of the rain. There is no implication that there are other places where it's not raining, so this should be 雨の中. There is no comparison between 内 and 外 here!\r\n\r\n#### 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES\r\n<a name='uchi'></a>\r\n\r\nAs you've seen, 中 is used simply to indicate a location. When 内 is chosen, on the other hand, there is a comparison between 内 and 外.\r\n\r\nUnlike 中, which can be used as a standalone word in various situations, 内 is more commonly used in jukugo (words that are made up of two or more kanji) when referring to physical spaces. These jukugo words usually come in pairs: one half of the pair is 内 plus another kanji, and the other half is 外 plus that same kanji.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common of these pairs is 内側うちがわ and 外側そとがわ. The kanji 側がわ means \"side\" and it makes it clearer that you are referring to either the inside or the outside of something. So if your teacher instructs you to write your name on the inside of your baseball cap, she may say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nキャップの内側に名前を書いてください。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nPlease write your name inside the baseball cap.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use 内 and not 中 here because you are not talking about the middle of your baseball cap, but rather the inside surface as opposed to the outside surface.\r\n\r\nYou'll also often hear 内側 in announcements on Japanese train station platforms, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n危険きけんですから、 白線はくせんの内側でお 待まち下さい。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nFor your safety, please wait behind the white line.\r\n(Literally: Because of the danger, please wait inside the white line.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, 内側 refers to the area behind the white line on the platform edge, and there is an implicit contrast with the other side of the white line, which is considered 外側.\r\n\r\nAnother common pair related to Japanese trains is 内回うちまわり and 外回そとまわり. The word 回まわり means \"rotation,\" and 内回り means \"the inside track\" as opposed to 外回り, which means \"the outside track.\"\r\n\r\nThis pair is often used to refer to double railway loop lines, like the famous Tokyo loop line, the Yamanote-sen, and its Osaka counterpart, the Kanjō-sen.\r\n\r\n![dumb thing](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/Yamanote-line.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs well as other kanji, 内 can also be combined with whole words to form jukugo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if 内 is combined with the word ポケット, as in 内うちポケット, it means an inside pocket. Although an outside pocket can be referred to as 外そとポケット, especially when you are making a comparison, it is more commonly just called ポケット.\r\n\r\nThis is probably because, just like in English, the word ポケット tends to make us think of a pocket on the outside. If we're talking about an inside pocket, we usually need to specify that, and there's generally an implied contrast with the outside pocket. Maybe you want to specify that you are talking about your hidden, inside pocket that you can hide your secret stuff in.\r\n\r\n![dumb thing](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2021-04-29-naka-vs-uchi/inner-pocket.jpg)\r\n\r\nSo to sum it up, when you want to highlight the inside half of a pair, you’d probably go with 内!\r\n\r\n#### 中 AND 内 WITH PHYSICAL SPACES\r\n<a name='and'></a>\r\nI hope you are getting the hang of it. Now let’s look at some examples of where both 中 and 内 are possible. The first example is yet another train-related one. You may hear the following announcement when you are in a Japanese train:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n車内しゃないでの 通話つうわはご 遠慮えんりょください。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nPlease refrain from making phone calls in the train.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, 車内 refers to the inside of the train, and its opposite is 車外, meaning \"outside the train.\" 1 Unlike the earlier gymnasium example, putting emphasis on the boundary between the inside and outside of the train car makes more sense here. It strengthens the point that you should not make phone calls inside the train, while implying that it’s okay to do so outside the train. This nuance is actually very subtle, and most Japanese speakers probably aren't even aware of it, but the implication is there nonetheless.\r\n\r\nYou could also use 中, as in 電車の中, and it simply indicates you are neutrally talking about the location in that case. However, train announcements always use 車内. Why? This actually has nothing to do with the nuance distinction between 内 and 中. It is simply a question of register: jukugo words (that's words consisting of two or more kanji) tend to sound more formal, so the use of 車内 rather than 電車の中 makes the announcement sound more official. Hence, the jukugo word 車内 is more suitable for official train announcements, while you can either use 電車の中 or 車内 in daily conversation depending on how casual or formal you want to sound.\r\n\r\nJust like Japanese train conductors asking people not to make calls in the train, teachers may tell students not to run inside the school building. In this case, they can use both 中 or 内, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n学校の中で走らない！\r\n校内で走らない！\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nDon’t run inside the school!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, 中 neutrally indicates the inside of the school, whereas 校内 highlights the boundary between the inside and outside of the school. Like the train announcement example, the differences between them are quite subtle and word choice may depend purely on the level of formality the person wants to convey. For example, teachers may go with 学校の中 for younger students, whereas 校内 may be selected for older students, since teachers tend to use more formal language with older students. There's also a question of understanding here, as younger students may understand 学校の中 more easily than 校内.\r\n\r\nOur next example is about a soccer rule:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\nペナルティエリアの中で 反則はんそくをすると、ペナルティキックになる。\r\nペナルティエリア 内ないで 反則はんそくをすると、ペナルティキックになる。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nIf you commit a foul in the penalty area, there'll be a penalty kick.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo refer to the inside of the penalty area, you can use both 中 or 内, but the nuances are slightly different. If you use 中, it simply indicates you are pointing to the inside of the penalty area, and that works just fine. On the other hand, 内 highlights the foul being made within the boundary of the penalty area. So if you’d like to put emphasis on the contrast between the penalty area and non-penalty area, then you might go with 内.\r\n\r\nWhat if you are talking about a bigger area, like a town? So let’s say your brother is the tallest person in the town where you live. When you say \"in the town\" like this, you’re not making a comparison between people inside and outside of the town. So, out of the two options, 中 is the most likely, though 内 can work too. 2\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n兄はこの町の中で一番 背せが高い。\r\n兄はこの町内で一番 背せが高い。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nMy brother is the tallest in this town.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason 内 also works is because you are technically highlighting the whole area of the town as a range of height comparison. It also inadvertently compares with the outside of the town, implying that he may not be the tallest person in the country, but he is the tallest in town. 3 So again, this comes down to personal choice and the nuance you want to convey.\r\n\r\nThe next example may be a little more challenging. Imagine you get into a quarrel with a family member. It upsets you, and you run into your room, slam the door, and lock it from the inside. In this case, either 中 or 内 can be used, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n中からカギをかけた。\r\n内からカギをかけた。\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nI locked the door from the inside.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using 中, you are simply indicating the location from which the door was locked. If you use 内, it highlights the door as the boundary between your room and the rest of the house. Choosing 内 could perhaps characterize your perception of the events that just occurred, and your mental and emotional state in response to it, such as feeling defensive towards what is outside of your room.\r\n\r\nNote that we used 内 alone in this example. It actually feels a bit archaic to use 内 alone when talking about physical spaces, and it generally establishes a literary or poetic tone. Unless that’s the style you’re aiming for, it’s more common to use the compound word 内側, which we saw earlier also means \"inside.\" So, if your little one locked you out and you are describing the situation objectively to your partner, either 中 or 内側 is probably your choice! If you're writing poetry, or writing in your diary about your emotions and want to add some literary flair, go ahead and use 内 on its own!\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning, though, that there are situations where the concepts suggest that both should be possible, but quirks in the way language develops mean that only one is actually used. For example, if your children are hyper and screaming in the house, you may tell them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJapanese\r\n⭕ 家の中でさけばない！\r\n❌ 家内でさけばない！\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\nDon't scream inside the house!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you are telling your child that it’s not okay to be loud inside the house, implying that it may be allowed outside. Even if you want to highlight this contrast, 内 is not an option.\r\n\r\nThis is because 家内 is already established as a completely different word. It is a slightly old-fashioned way of saying \"my wife,\" so it cannot be used to refer to the inside of the house. Cases like this are the exception rather than the rule, though, and you'll get to know them over time.\r\n\r\n### LOTS MORE WORDS IN REAL LIFE!\r\n<a name='more'></a>\r\n\r\nWe are coming to the end of our exploration of 中 and 内. Hopefully you were able to grasp the basic concepts of these two words, and are now coming away with a better feel for how these two words are used in the real world.\r\n\r\nTo wrap it up, 中 neutrally refers to the middle, medium, or central position or part, while 内 refers to an inside that is surrounded by an outside, highlighting the boundary between the inside and the outside.\r\n\r\n中 and 内 are very common words and we didn’t cover all of their uses in this article, so you’ll still run into new usages in the wild. Before you forget what you learned here, or 忘わすれない内に, please try to remember the 中 and 内 uses you’ve encountered before, and consider why each was chosen. And of course, keep an eye out for these words as you read and listen to Japanese. It will help consolidate your idea of the two words, and you’ll be better equipped for the new uses awaiting you!"}]
